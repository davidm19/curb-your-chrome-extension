# Curb Your Chrome Extension
It's pretty good. Prettay, prettay, prettay, prettay good.

## Background
I'm not gonna lie: I get myself into some pretty sticky situations, socially speaking. One moment I'm late for an appointment because I wrote down the date wrong, the next moment I accidentally read-end someone in front of the police while running late for another appointment, and the next moment I disappoint my teacher by turning in an empty test I didn't study for. In every case, the one thing I've needed is a cherry to put on top of this sticky situation: The Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song.

Its very existence is to mark the occasion of someone screwing up royally. This used to apply only to Larry David, but now, thanks to this Chrome extension, everybody can enjoy a slice of the party, from accidentally putting a typo into your aunt-in-law's obituary to giving a maitre d' of a restaurant your wife's skin cream prescription instead of money and then immediately getting kicked out of a pharmacy for trying to bribe a pharmacist to let you cut in line. There's no situation where this button is "no good."
