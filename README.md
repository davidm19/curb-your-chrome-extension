# Curb Your Chrome Extension
It's pretty good. Prettay, prettay, prettay, prettay good.

## Background
I'm not gonna lie: I get myself into some pretty sticky situations, socially speaking. One moment I'm interrupting a class's end of year discussion (which counts pretty heavily for their grade) just to return a Franz Kafka short stories anthology, the next moment I accidentally read-end someone in front of the police while running late for cross country practice. In every case, the one thing I've needed is a cherry to put on top of this sticky situation: The Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song.

Its very existence is to mark the occasion of someone screwing up royally. This used to apply only to Larry David, but now, thanks to memes and the internet, and pretty soon this Chrome extension, everybody can enjoy a slice of the party, from accidentally putting a typo into your aunt-in-law's obituary to giving a maitre d' of a restaurant your wife's skin cream prescription instead of money and then immediately getting kicked out of a pharmacy for trying to bribe a pharmacist to let you cut in line. There's not situation where this button is "no good."
